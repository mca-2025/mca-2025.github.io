    "Ms.ghing":"My name is Perlita Castillo, but my students call me Ms. Ghing. I am the Red Room Directress.  I have three children (Camille, 27, Cali, 22, and Cameron, 14), and three grandchildren (Mila, Max, and Mya). Teaching was something I never thought I would take on as a profession. However, when I went to observe LorJon Montessori School for my daughter, Camille, who was then only 3 years old, the classroom opened a different sense of calling and belonging for me. As if it were my destiny to be there, to teach, guide, nurture, and learn alongside the children. After several weeks of volunteering at LorJon, I made a phone call to MMTTC inquiring about their Teacher Training schedule, and the rest was history. After LorJon closed its doors in 2018, I started my own tutoring business. With the help of my almost two decades of Montessori teaching experience and skills, I was able to continue to help educate and provide strong academic skills, critical thinking abilities, and foster a love of learning in my private tutoring students. When tutoring, I was fortunate to work with children between the ages of 3-13 years old, some with learning disabilities, IEP, and on the Autism Spectrum. Regardless of a child’s academic level, I am dedicated to seeing my students thrive and succeed, not just academically but also socially and emotionally! This is why I am delighted for the opportunity to join MCA, and I am thrilled to share my passion for Early Childhood Education and my dedication to making a positive impact on the lives of my students!",

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Early Childhood and Elementary Education from National Louis University, an endorsement in Bilingual Education, and earned my Infant/Toddler Montessori credential from Seton Montessori Institute. In my dual role, I have the privilege of supporting both our youngest learners and our dedicated teaching staff. As a bilingual educator, I love incorporating Spanish into our daily routines through songs, conversations, and activities that celebrate language and culture. Sharing my own culture with the children and our school community is something I value deeply, and I believe that creating an inclusive, welcoming environment for all is essential. Every day is a new opportunity to learn, not only from our students but also from each other. It is truly rewarding to watch each child grow, explore, and discover their unique potential. I believe that when we model kindness, curiosity, and respect, children are empowered to do the same. In a Montessori environment, their natural desire to learn transforms them into joyful explorers of the world around them.",
